                <h3>INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHIC DESIGN</h3><br>
                <p3>Graphic design focuses on communicating a message visually. The message may be to provide<br> information,
                    invoke thought, sell a product or even stimulate meaningful conversation. Graphic design is all<br> around you. It’s about
                    expressing an idea in the best way using visual story telling. This may sound<br> simple, but it requires problem solving,
                    communication, attentiveness, patience, and most importantly<br> a good grasp of the project’s desired result.</p3><br><br>
